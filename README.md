This MATLAB script solves a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) related to fluid flow and porosity changes in a geological context using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The script calculates the pressure and porosity over time, compares the numerical solutions to exact solutions, and plots the results.

It also explores the accuracy of different numerical methods, including the Euler method and a modified midpoint method, by calculating and plotting the errors as a function of step size.
